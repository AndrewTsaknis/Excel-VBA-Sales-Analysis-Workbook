# Sales Data Automation with Excel VBA 📊⚙️

## 📌 Project Summary
This project automates repetitive tasks in sales reporting using Excel VBA.  
The goal is to streamline data analysis by generating pivot tables, calculating total revenue, and comparing salesperson performance week over week — all through automated macros.

The workbook includes VBA scripts that:
- Clean and prepare sales data  
- Create pivot tables dynamically  
- Summarize total revenue  
- Analyze weekly salesperson performance  
- Automate report sheet creation  

This project demonstrates practical Excel automation, VBA scripting, and data analysis workflows for business reporting.

## 📂 Workbook Structure

Ensure the following sheets exist (many will be auto-generated by macros):

- `Sheet1` – Raw sales data  
- Auto-created pivot table sheets  
- `Salesperson Performance` – Week-over-week comparison  
- Any additional sheets created by macros during runtime  

The macros are designed to run without manually renaming sheets.

## 🔧 VBA Macros Included

### **1. Create Pivot Table with Revenue**
Automatically generates a pivot table summarizing **Total Price by Region**.  
Revenue is calculated as:


### **2. Add Slicers for Interactive Dashboards**
A macro adds slicers that let users filter dashboards by:
- Discount  
- Promotion  
- Region  
- Salesperson  
- PaymentMethod  

This enables quick, interactive analysis (for example: view only promotional sales or only orders with discounts).

### **3. Week-Over-Week Salesperson Performance**
Creates a comparison table showing:
- Sales per week  
- Change from the previous week  
- Ranking of salespeople  

Useful for tracking performance trends.

### **4. (Optional) Filled Map Chart**
A placeholder macro exists for generating a filled-map chart based on region revenue.  
*This macro is not yet implemented.*
